About the Program 
</h1>


<p class="para">
 As the Binghamton University Bike Share, we know that each student has his or her biking needs. Some may not be willing to pay the hundreds needed 
 for a new bike.  Others may not have convenient storage space.  Still, others may simply not ride often enough to warrant buying a bike.  We want 
 to provide a quality biking experience that is fun, safe, and easy for all by suiting individual needs.
 </p>
 <p class="para">
 Bicycles have several benefits.  They are environmentally-friendly alternatives to cars, yet give users the flexibility to ride where they need to go, 
 when they need to go there.  Rather than depending only on restrictive bus schedules, combining bicycling with public transit (with bus-bike racks) leads 
 to an affordable and green way of transportation.  Riding bikes also helps improve health and wellness, especially around the hilly Binghamton terrain. 
 Insufficient parking and traffic congestion may be alleviated, and a bike share provides a great opportunity and platform to reduce campus carbon footprints 
 and increase student engagement.  Lastly, riding bikes is fun, and group rides can be a great way to meet new people!
</p>
 <p class="para">
 By launching our pilot program in November of 2013, BUBS has ignited the interest of students and faculty.  Eventually, we would like to expand the program 
 into the city for residents to use in conjunction with the proposed Greenway project, an integral connection between the campus and the City of Binghamton.

<h1 class="title1">
	Press Release 
</h1>

<p class="para">
		The Binghamton Bike Share is a student-run program that provide bikes to students and faculty at Binghamton University. The pilot program was 
	 launched November 1, 2013 and had over 160 hours of use and 40 unique users in its first month. The program is currently shut down for the winter, 
	 but will relaunch in the spring as early as weather permits. We currently have 7 bikes, but as more funds are acquired we will hopefully obtain 
	 more bikes from Cornell’s or Stony Brook’s bike sharing programs.
	 
<p class="para">
		In the near future, we will be constructing an automated hub system on our campus which will allow registered users to borrow bikes and ride 
	them around the campus and community. The program aims to reduce automobile traffic on campus by allowing users to ride from the commuter lots and 
	residence halls to other areas around campus quickly and efficiently. Eventual goals include connecting the campus and community with a pedestrian 
	and bike trail and expanding the system to the city of Binghamton.</p>

<h1 class="title1">
	Program Implementation
</h1>

<!--PHASE 1-->
<h4 class="title2">Phase I</h4>

	<ul type="circle">
	
		<li class="list">This phase has been completed.  The Bike Share's pilot phase was intended to speed up the process of introducing the concept of a Bike 
		Share to Binghamton's campus.  By doing so, the student acclimated to the idea of a bike share by incorporating it into daily life. 
		It also served as a beneficial advertisement for the program as it began to expand into further phases of development.</li>

		<li class="list">The pilot phase included 7 bicycles donated from the Outdoor Pursuits office (see Bike Unit section).  They were manually signed out. 
		The hardware was simple and straightforward to use.  Ease of use of the bike share is the main priority in order to encourage frequent
		use by the student body.</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	
<!--PHASE 2-->
<h4 class="title2">Phase II</h4>

	<ul type="circle">

		<li class="list">The second phase of the program is meant to expand both the number of bicycles and the main method of rental.</li>
	
		<li class="list">Once more funding is given to the bike share more bikes will be purchased. </li>

		<li class="list">Additionally, the Bike Share plans to expand to 3rd generation system.  A Senior Design Project for the Thomas J. Watson School of 
		Engineering and Applied Science class of 2014 is in progress.  This will allow for an electronic system to check bikes in and out, 
		increasing efficiency and ease-of-use by eliminating the need for manual check-out.  Users will also be able to check current bicycle
		locations via the internet and/or SmartPhone application.  Ideally, a designated Bike Share coordinator will be assigned a paid position
		each school year to ensure that the program continues. </li>

		<li class="list">Hubs will be located in accordance with where students most need them. Potential locations include Bartle Library, Lecture Hall, Union, 
		East and West Gym, ITC Center, and the residential communities.</li> 

		<li class="list">BUBS will keep up-to-date on improvements and headway made by bike share programs at other universities and cities and incorporate
		relevant lessons learned into the program. </li>

	</ul>

<!--PHASE 3-->
<h4 class="title2">Phase III</h4> 

	<ul type="circle">

		<li class="list">The third phase of the program includes the expansion to Downtown Binghamton to allow members of the community to participate. We hope
		that this expansion will coincide with the Binghamton Greenway Project.  The Greenway, a pedestrian and bicycling-only pathway connection 
		between BU and downtown, will make it possible for efficient and quick transportation to and from campus.  As a result of the expansion, 
		BUBS will promote a healthy and sustainable lifestyle for the campus and surrounding community.</li>
